well as provide access to the documents.
* **Last Updated**: 2010
* **Documentation**: Only in the source-code.
* **Technologies Used**: PHP/MySQL
* **License Type**: Unknown
* **Notes**: It hasn't been updated in a couple of years, however PHP/MySQL hasn't changed that much, so the source-code could still be relevant, however the bug tracker hasn't been active since 2008.

### [eprints](http://www.eprints.org/)

* **License Type**: GPL
* **Last Updated**: Actively Maintained.
* **Documentation**: Well documented.
* **Technologies Used**: Perl.
* **Notes**: It's a little bit weird that there are cross-platform clients, when it could easily work as a web-based application. The only thing I can think of is that it's such an old project that they have kept with plat-form specific clients to continue supporting their user base, however in a modern context it doesn't really make any sense.

* **Description**: Greenstone is a suite of software for building and distributing digital library collections.

* **Documentation**: Well documented, but the hierarchy of information is poorly organized. [Youtube Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbI0mEszg5s)

* **Technologies Used**: PHP.
* **Notes**: I think the description is out of date because it appears to be a web-based PHP application, I don't see any cross-platform files. The code is well-structured and the SQL is abstracted. The basic templates and UI design are poorly designed, and the markup outdated, however that can be easily modified.
