##Definition

Let's start by defining a **Social Knowledge Creation Tool**, it is an application that enables researchers to collaborate  

##Properties

###Open Source

Open Source SKCTs are typically tools that have been made to be re-used and re-purposed, rather than tools that you can use out of the box.

* **License Type**: The type of license dictates how the software can be used, most open-source software uses variations of the following families of licenses:
	* *BSD* Licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software.
	* *GNU GPL* License is the most widely used software license, which guarantees end users the freedoms to use, study, copy, and modify the software.
	* *MIT* License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms.
* **Last Updated**: It's important to know that a project is being actively maintained, if it hasn't been updated in several years then you could be dealing with deprecated/legacy code.
* **Documentation**: Well documented source can make all the difference. A new developer should be able to pick up a project 
* **Technologies Used**: This is important because it describes the requirements of the server environment to run these scripts

###Web-Based

Web-Based tools are typically services or browser extensions. They are usually closed-source, as they're not designed to be shared, however many of these services offer an Application Programming Interface (API).
