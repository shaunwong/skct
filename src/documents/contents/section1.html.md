##Definition

In our conception of the term, a Social Knowledge Creation Tool (SKCT) is a usable technology that encourages the collaborative work of multiple individuals in a networked, digital environment. Furthermore, a social knowledge creation tool supports the active generation of work, information, or knowledge in an ethos of sharing, contact, and openness.  

##Context

The tools on this list have been evaluated on how they can be used for social knowledge creation, or as assets to create new SKCTs within the context of Digital Humanities (DH).

##Types

* **Dedicated tools**: Tools whose primary purpose is social knowledge construction. These digital tools are designed, implemented, and used with social knowledge creation as their main objective.

* **Application-oriented tools**: Tools that were not necessarily or primarily designed with social knowledge creation as an overarching objective. These tools, however, are frequently used for this end via re-purposingâ€”the social knowledge creation is more user-based than designer-based.

* **Peripherally-oriented tools**: Tools that were not designed with social knowledge creation in mind, but nonetheless facilitate social knowledge creation through communication and interaction.

##Properties

###Open Source

Open Source SKCTs are typically tools that have been made to be re-used and re-purposed, rather than tools that you can use out of the box.

* **License Type**: The type of license dictates how the software can be used, most open-source software uses variations of the following families of licenses:
	* *BSD* Licenses are a family of permissive free software licenses, imposing minimal restrictions on the redistribution of covered software.
	* *GNU GPL* License is the most widely used software license, which guarantees end users the freedoms to use, study, copy, and modify the software.
	* *MIT* License is a free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). It is a permissive free software license, meaning that it permits reuse within proprietary software provided all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms.

* **Last Updated**: It's important to know that a project is being actively maintained, if it hasn't been updated in several years then you could be dealing with deprecated/legacy code.

* **Documentation**: Well documented source can make all the difference. A new developer should be able to pick up a project 

* **Technologies Used**: This is important because it describes the environment required to deploy and run said open-source SKCT.


###Web-Based

Web-Based tools are typically services or browser extensions. Services are usually closed-source, as they're not designed to be shared, however many of these services offer an Application Programming Interface (API). Browser extensions are typically javascript applications, who's source is seldom open.

##Categories

* **Collaborative Annotation**: Annotatinon is a crucial scholarly editorial activity that can be enhanced with social tools to fuel social knowledge creation.
* **User-derived Content**: the collection and management of searchable exhibits that are composed of multiple digital objects.
* **Folksonomy Tagging**: Social tagging involves multiple users collaboratively adding keywords/tags to annotate and categorize content.
* **Community Bibliography**: These utilities allow researchers to to ctalog and reference resources using academic citations, folksonomy tagging, and link sharing.
* **Shared Text Analysis**: DH textual analysis involves the application of algorithms to facilitate the search, retrieval and analysis of digital documents.
* **Gamification Tools** (working title...): The ability to integrate game-like features that can expand social experiences when engaging in social knowledge creation with others. These tools include things like reward-systems.
